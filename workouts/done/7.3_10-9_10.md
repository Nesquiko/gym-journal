# Workouts for 3.10. - 9.10.2022

## Monday 3.10.

1. ATG Squats
   - Decided to do this instead of 120kg.
   - On 3rd rep, I had to fight, but did them all ATG.
   - working sets: 3 x 3 x 100kg
   - rest in-between: 2'
2. Leg extensions
   - Good burn, legs were feeling it.
   - working sets: 5 x 20 x start at 30kg +10kg per set
   - rest in-between: 30"
3. Step-ups
   - For some reason (maybe because I was sick whole week?), these were tough.
   - Not the burn, but even to finish them was tough.
   - working sets: 3 x 15 per leg
   - rest in-between: 30"
4. Standing calf raises
   - Started failing at around 10 reps in.
   - working sets: 4 x 12 x 90kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
5. Seated calf raises
   - Very good pump, but I feel that my right calf is doing less work.
   - working sets: 4 x 20 x 40kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
6. Stretching
   - standing quads stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
