# Workouts for 3.10. - 9.10.2022

## Monday 3.10.

1. ATG Squats
   - Decided to do this instead of 120kg.
   - On 3rd rep, I had to fight, but did them all ATG.
   - working sets: 3 x 3 x 100kg
   - rest in-between: 2'
2. Leg extensions
   - Good burn, legs were feeling it.
   - working sets: 5 x 20 x start at 30kg +10kg per set
   - rest in-between: 30"
3. Step-ups
   - For some reason (maybe because I was sick whole week?), these were tough.
   - Not the burn, but even to finish them was tough.
   - working sets: 3 x 15 per leg
   - rest in-between: 30"
4. Standing calf raises
   - Started failing at around 10 reps in.
   - working sets: 4 x 12 x 90kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
5. Seated calf raises
   - Very good pump, but I feel that my right calf is doing less work.
   - working sets: 4 x 20 x 40kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
6. Stretching
   - standing quads stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
   - leg over leg glute stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
   - calf stretch against wall: 3 x 15" per calf

## Tuesday 4.10.

1. Deficit deadlift
   - Firstly it was weird, but then I noticed how the inintial lift is heavier and also whole lift was long (don't say...).
   - working sets: 3 x 5 x 100kg
   - rest in-between: 1'
2. Pullups
   - Suprisingly these went more easily than I anticipated.
   - working sets: 4 x 8
   - rest in-between: 1'
3. One arm dumbbell row
   - Left arm was slowly hitting failure. Also my lower back was twisted in weird way, so be careful with your position on this.
   - working sets: 5 x 8 per hand + 8 with left x 25kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
4. One arm lat pulldowns
   - Muscle connection with my left arm is nearly non-existent. Right arm is smooth, but left needs some work to be done.
   - working sets: 5 x 12 per hand + 12 with left x 12.5
   - rest in-between: 30"
5. EZ bar bicep curl
   - I was suprised that I did 4 sets per 8 reps with 30" rest.
   - working sets: 4 x 8 x 10kg per side
   - rest in-between: 30"
6. Spider curl with EZ bar
   - Must try to add hold on top, otherwise I don't think it is good enough.
   - working sets: 4 x 10 x 10kg per side
   - rest in-between: 30"
7. Stretching
   - elbow over head stetch: 3 x 15" per arm
   - on knees lats stretch: 2 x 15" per direction
   - bicep stretch: 3 x 15" per arm
