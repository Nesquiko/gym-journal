# Workouts for 26.9. - 3.10.2022

## Monday 26.9.

I catched a cold (probably) during the weekend, today I woke up with mildly
runy nose, but otherwise nothing. In the gym I had some weird moments, and
a cold sweat. The strength was there, but I didn't want to push it and end
up in bed for the rest of the week. Or maybe I'm ok, and I made the feelings
in my mind and fell for the placebo.

1. Squats with belt
   - working sets: 1 x 130kg
   - The depth was there, knees caved in little bit, but otherwise I am happy.
2. Stretching
   - standing quads stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
