# Workouts for 29.8. - 3.9.2022

## Monday 29.8.

Time: 1h

I didn't have any crapms, muscles have accommodated quite quickly.
Of course, they will be sore tomorrow, but I could finish the workouts
without need to stop because of cramp or because I couldn't continue.

1. Squats
   - I couldn't figure out how to brace my stomach.
   - Technique was good on first two reps in each set, then got worse, pelvis and trunk didn't move together.
   - working sets: 4 x 4 x 100kg
   - rest in-between: 1'30"
2. Leg extensions
   - To the end I barely did 20 reps, so I guess good.
   - working sets: 5 x 20 x start at 35, +5kg on each set
   - rest in-between: 30"
3. Step-ups
   - After first set I must've used smaller side of box. My quads were burning. Good finisher.
   - working sets: 3 x 15 per leg
   - rest in-between: 30"
4. Seated calf raises
   - This was easy, I think 12 to 15 reps per this weight appropriate.
   - working sets: 4 x 10 x 50kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
5. Standing calf raises
   - This was perfect, weight, reps, stretching. Good pump and good feeling after.
   - working sets: 4 x 20 x 50kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
6. Stretching
   - standing quads stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
   - leg over leg glute stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
   - calf stretch against wall with leg behind: 3 x 15" per calf

   - Technique felt on point, core bracing was good, the weight felt moderately heavy
   - working sets: 4 x 4 x 100kg

   - Even the first ones felt rusty, I think i should put elbows more behind body.

## Wednesday 31.8.

Time: 1h 6m

After the workout, my pecs were like baloons. Good workout!

1. Bench Press
   - It wasn't smooth, and I struggled on some reps, but I did it.
   - working sets: 6 x 6 x 60kg
   - rest in-between: 1'
2. Dumbell bench press
   - The bench press fatigued me, so here I was forced to drop weight to get 12 reps in. Also the rest time was short for this.
   - working sets: 5 x 12 x 20kg + drop to 15kg if needed
   - rest in-between: 30" to 1'
3. Inclince dumbell bench press
   - The reps were short, I would be more satisfied wiht more depth, but the pump was visible.
   - working sets: 5 x 10-12 x 15kg
   - rest in-between: 30" to 45"
4. Cable crossover
   - I dropped the weight to get 20 reps in. And after 10-12 reps, this exercise became chest flys on cables ðŸ˜‚.
   - working sets: 4 x 20 x 6kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
5. Underhand triceps extensions
   - 10 resp is low, either add weight, or increase reps.
   - working sets: 4 x 10 x 20kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
6. Triceps leaning overhead extensions
   - The weight was heavy, decrease it for that rep range. These were supposed to be Incline dumbell power bombs, but all benches were taken.
   - working sets: 4 x 10-15 x 15kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
7. Face pulls with cable
   - Once again, I fell in love with these. My upper traps and upper back are feeling good after.

   - rest in-between: 30"
