# Workouts for 29.8. - 3.9.2022

## Monday 29.8.

Time: 1h

I didn't have any crapms, muscles have accommodated quite quickly.
Of course, they will be sore tomorrow, but I could finish the workouts
without need to stop because of cramp or because I couldn't continue.

1. Squats
	- I couldn't figure out how to brace my stomach. 
	- Technique was good on first two reps in each set, then got worse, pelvis and trunk didn't move together.
	- working sets: 4 x 4 x 100kg
	- rest in-between: 1'30"
2. Leg extensions
	- To the end I barely did 20 reps, so I guess good.
	- working sets: 5 x 20 x start at 35, +5kg on each set
	- rest in-between: 30"
3. Step-ups
	- After first set I must've used smaller side of box. My quads were burning. Good finisher.
	- working sets: 3 x 15 per leg
	- rest in-between: 30"
4. Seated calf raises
	- This was easy, I think 12 to 15 reps per this weight appropriate.
	- working sets: 4 x 10 x 50kg
	- rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
5. Standing calf raises
	- This was perfect, weight, reps, stretching. Good pump and good feeling after.
	- working sets: 4 x 20 x 50kg
	- rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
6. Stretching
	- standing quads stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
	- leg over leg glute stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
	- calf stretch against wall with leg behind: 3 x 15" per calf
