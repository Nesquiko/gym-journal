# Workouts for 5.9. - 10.9.2022

## Monday 5.9.

Time: 56m

1. Squats with belt
   - Whole body felt solid with belt, the weight moved relatively easily.
   - I have atleast one rep with 120kg in me.
   - working sets: 3 x 3 x 110kg
   - rest in-between: 2"
2. Dumbell lunges
   - Increase reps, weight was adequate.
   - working sets: 4 x 8 x 30kg in hand
   - rest in-between: 1'
3. Step-ups
   - Although my quads were burning, I should increase reps to 15, 12 is the point where it starts to burn.
   - working sets: 3 x 12 per leg
   - rest in-between: 30"
4. Seated calf raises
   - Either increase reps or weight, didn't feel any fatigue, done all 4 sets easily.

## Tuesday 6.9.

Time: 1h 1m

1. Deadlift
   - What was I thinking on Sunday?! 10 reps pumped my lower back, without any pain, just pumped.
   - working sets: 4 x 10 x 80kg
   - rest in-between: 1'
2. Pullups
   - Really struggled to get 8 in every set. Maybe longer rest would benefit me.
   - working sets: 4 x 8
   - rest in-between: 1'
3. Bent over row, underhand
   - Biceps were first to give up, also my flexibility in rotating my palms so I can hold the bar is no great.
   - working sets: 5 x 10 x 50kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
4. One arm seated cable row
   - Right hand felt good, but left hand was weird. I didn't feel contraction and I didn't feel in control as with the right hand.
   - working sets: 5 x 12 per arm x 20kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
5. Alternating dumbell curl
   - Not great, not terrible. I managed all the reps without any failure, but 12,5 would be too much.
   - working sets: 4 x 10 per hand x 10kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
6. Incline waiter curl
   - Why didn't I read previous week? I had to grind to get atleast 12 reps.
   - working sets: 4 x 12 x 20kg
   - rest in-between: 30"
