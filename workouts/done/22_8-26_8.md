# Workouts for 22.8. - 26.8.2022

## Monday 22.8.

Well, I got crushed, the 2 month pause was I guess too much for my body. Every
exercise on plan was reduced, either in weight user, or in count of reps. And 
now I'm walking like a rusty robot. Also my body control and coordination was
really bad, I didn't feel like I was 100% in control.

1. Squats
	- Every rep of the working sets was painful, cramps in quads or muscle fatigue.
	- working sets: 4 x 6 x 80kg
	- rest in-between: 1'
2. Reverse lunges
	- I did only bodyweight and that was plenty.
	- working sets: 4 x 10 per leg 
	- rest in-between: 30"
3. Standing calf raises
	- I learned from the first two exercises, so I took it slowly.
	- working sets: 4 x 20 x 20kg
	- rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
4. Seated calf raises
	- Good, got pumped, adequate weight.
	- working sets: 4 x 20 x 25kg
	- rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
5. Stretching
	- standing quads stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
	- lying glutes stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
	- calf stretch against wall: 3 x 15" per calf
