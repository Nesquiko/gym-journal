# Workouts for 22.8. - 26.8.2022

## Monday 22.8.

Well, I got crushed, the 2 month pause was I guess too much for my body. Every
exercise on plan was reduced, either in weight user, or in count of reps. And 
now I'm walking like a rusty robot. Also my body control and coordination was
really bad, I didn't feel like I was 100% in control.

1. Squats
	- Every rep of the working sets was painful, cramps in quads or muscle fatigue.
	- working sets: 4 x 6 x 80kg
	- rest in-between: 1'
2. Reverse lunges
	- I did only bodyweight and that was plenty.
	- working sets: 4 x 10 per leg 
	- rest in-between: 30"
3. Standing calf raises
	- I learned from the first two exercises, so I took it slowly.
	- working sets: 4 x 20 x 20kg
	- rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
4. Seated calf raises
	- Good, got pumped, adequate weight.
	- working sets: 4 x 20 x 25kg
	- rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
5. Stretching
	- standing quads stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
	- lying glutes stretch: 3 x 15" per leg
	- calf stretch against wall: 3 x 15" per calf 

## Tuesday 23.8.

The muscle soreness is through the roof ðŸ˜‚. Today's workout was more appropriate
than yesterday's, only few changes were made due to my not being able to complete/
not able to continue with the plan as written. This mid workout will end, after
I get back in shape more.

1. Deadlift
	- Felt really good, even though my whole lower body is in hell.
	- working sets: 4 x 10 x 60kg
	- rest in-between: 1'
2. Pullups
	- Surprisingly easy, I expected more struggle.
	- working sets: 5 x 5
	- rest in-between: 1'
3. Seated cable row
	- My biceps and forearms were first to give in, adequate weight.
	- working sets: 5 x 12 x 45kg
	- rest in-between: 30"
4. Pullover
	- This was fun and walk through hell, my tris will be sore tomorrow, maybe even today
	- working sets: 5 x 15 x 20kg
	- rest in-between: 30"

	- rest in-between: 30"
6. Alternating Biceps Dumbell curls

## Wednesday 24.8.

1. Bench Press
	- Firstly was unsure I felt stiff and weak, but then grinded the 4 sets of 6.
	- working sets: 4 x 6 x 60kg
	- rest in-between: 1'
2. Inclince barbell bench press 
	- In the plan was dumbell, but benches were full. Partial reps on this really pumped the pecs.
	- working sets: 5 x 10 x 30kg
	- rest in-between: 30"
3. Cable crossover
	- This was a mix, first 6 to 7 reps were easy, but then it hit hard.
	- working sets: 4 x 12 x 8kg
	- rest in-between: 30"
4. Dumbell bench press
	- Couldn't move 15kgs for 10 reps. So I decided to skip this.
5. Lying Triceps extensions (ez bar)
	- Stretched the tris and pumped them, felt good.
	- working sets: 4 x 12 x 5kg per side
	- rest in-between: 30"
6. Incline Dumbell Powerbombs 
	- Tried the setup, I think I can improve it, but when my tris will be stronger.
7. Face pulls with double rope
	- Double rope is really good, I like do this variation.
	- working sets: 4 x 10 x 12.5
	- rest in-between: 30"
8. Stretching
	- elbow over head stetch: 3 x 15" per arm 
	- chest stretch against wall: 3 x 15" per arm 
	- jesus with trx: 3 x 15" 

## Thursday 25.8.

1. Squats
	- Only lifted the bar, my quads are still sore from monday.
	- working sets: 3 x 12 x 20kg
	- rest in-between: 30"

	- Decreased weight to 30kg to get the wanted 6 reps per set. Otherwise it felt good, 40kg next week.
	- working sets: 4 x 6 x 30kg
	- rest in-between: 1'

	- rest in-between: 30"
5. Dumbell lateral raise
	- These felt really good, pumped up my shoulders.
