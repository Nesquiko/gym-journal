# Workouts for 12.12. - 18.12.2022

## Monday 12.12.

1. Squats with belt
   - I was really confident, in future try 130kg first, to see how are you feeling that day
   - working sets: 2 x 1 x 140kg
   - rest in-between: 2'
2. Squats
   - Probably could go for 8 reps but the technique would be terrible
   - working sets: 3 x 6 x 100kg
   - rest in-between: 1'
3. One leg seated calf raises
   - No burn, only light muscle fatigue
   - I feel like my right leg is being more stable when I am concentrated on it
   - working sets: 4 x 10 per leg + 8 with right x 20kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2 x 8' per leg + 30"
4. One leg standing calf raises
   - Did this on smith machine, liked it more than only with a step up and ladder
   - Intense burn
   - working sets: 4 x 15 per leg + 10 with right x 15kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2 x 8' per leg + 30"
