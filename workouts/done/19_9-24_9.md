# Workouts for 19.9. - 24.9.2022

## Monday 19.9.

1. Squats with belt
   - I squated 130kg, but depth was not there, didn't break parallel.
   - I got scared, I need to get more comfortable with the feeling that there are no safety pins.
   - working sets: 1 x 130kg
2. Dumbell lunges
   - Only was out of breath, legs were fine, heavy with lower reps seems better.
   - working sets: 4 x 10 per leg x 20kg in hand
   - rest in-between: 1'
3. Leg press
   - My legs were shaking, this suprised me, try it more.
   - working sets: 4 x 15 x 100kg
   - rest in-between: 1'
4. Step-ups
   - Burn baby burn.
   - working sets: 3 x 15 per leg
   - rest in-between: 30"
5. Leg press calf raise
   - The other machine was occupied, so did this.
   - I can touch my calves on this one. My right calf isn't as developed as left one.
   - working sets: 4 x 12 x 150kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
6. Seated calf raises
   - Started to hit failure at around 15 reps in, really felt the burn.
   - working sets: 4 x 20 x 35kg
   - rest in-between: stretch calves 2x8' per leg + 30"
