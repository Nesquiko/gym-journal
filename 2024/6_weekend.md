## 6.1.

Went to gym after a swim, this wasn't the optimal choice. Strength wasn't there,
so pushed with intensity, not weight.

1. Bench press
   - 2 x 8 x 80kg
2. Incline dumbbell bench press
   - 3 x 8 - 12 x 28kg
3. Cable flys
   - 2 x (~12 x 12.5kg in each hand + UF x 10kg in each hand)
4. Dumbbell lateral raise
   - 3 x 16 x 10kg
5. Dumbbell reverse flies
   - 3 x 20 x 7kg
6. Stretching
