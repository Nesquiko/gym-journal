## To the end of September: (0/3)

I didn't accomplish my set goald. I catched cold last week and didn't go to gym.
However, I comfortably squated 130kg. On deadlift I am sure I could hit 140kg,
and Bench press is I guess 2 weeks from 80kg.

- hit 140kg on deadlift ❌
- hit 140kg on squat ❌
- hit 80kg on bench ❌
