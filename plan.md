# Gym plan for 2022

### Gym days: 5 (+1 stretching session)

### Split

1. Heavy Squats (higher weight, less reps) and calves
2. Light Deadlift (lower weight, more reps), Back and Bis
3. Bench Press and Tris
4. Light Squats (lower weight, more reps), Shoulders
5. Heavy Deadlift (higher weight, less reps) and Abs
6. Stretching session (20 to 30 minutes)

#### Comments

The shoulders after bench press and tris might be a little problem,
but I will try it like this and see how it feels.

## Process

To achieve the end goal, just follow the process.
That's all, simply follow the process outlined here.

**But, it is easier said than done!**

### Prepare workouts for the week on every sunday

**Prepare workouts for the incoming week in advance. Not later than on sunday.**

* Think about them, always improve.
* Build the workouts with the previous week in mind.
	* Was last week the weight light on the Bench Press? Increase it!
	* Was the weight too much, you didn't hit the reps that you should've? Decrease the weight and up the reps!
* Do not exactly repeat last weeks workouts. Change the reps, the weights, something...
* Do not be afraid to experiment.

### Follow the plan

**Don't change workout in the middle of it, follow your plan exactly.**

Only change when:
1. An equipment/place is taken and you don't have time to wait.
2. You will increase the reps, sets, add exercise. Basically only when you will be doin more.
3. Injury

You need to shit? Go and return back to complete the workout. You feel like
there are too many sets/reps? Well, tell that to the future you, when you
will be preparing next weeks workouts, and finish today's workout as you
have written it!

### Document workouts

After a workout, write down all the exercises, how many sets and reps you did.
Also write down your feelings, emotions, experiences, all thoughts about the
workout that were in your head.

### Hit gym atleast 5 times a week

Each day of the week, or if you can't, gym is also opened on the weekends!

Sometimes you won't feel the motivation, or the joy of going to the gym, or
being in the gym. Well, raise the volume of the music, grow some balls, shorten
the breaks in between the sets and finish the workout.

### F\*ck other people

THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU, SO DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM!

Does the exercise look stupid, but is it good exercise? Then do it and f\*ck others.
Look to the ground if you think others are looking at you.

### Stay consistent with nutrition

Do not throw whole week of healthy eating into a bin on weekends.
* DO NOT open the fridge when you don't know what you want.
* DO NOT open the candy locker when you are bored.

* You want something sweet, eat an apple, banana...
* Want a snack eat oatmeal, fruit, white yogurth...
* Nothing healthy is cooked? Make eggs, or eat tuna...

### Sleep and regenerate

Sleep atleast 8 hours a day, no questions asked!

Boys are on the discord, join them only if you have time. Once in the bed, don't
browse on phone, make a remainder if you forgot about something.

In the gym, stretch the muscle group you worked on that day. Or use roller.
Once a week have a stretching session, about 20 to 30 minutes of pure stretching.

Also eat protein and healthy carbs!
