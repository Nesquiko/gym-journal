# Gym goals for 2023

## April (1/3)

- 8 x 130kg on squat
- 8 x 130kg on deadlift
- 5 x 80kg on bench press ✔️

## To the end of march

I did only singles, and twos, and that was a mistake. In the end of the month
I couldn't go heavier. So I must do more reps, even with lower weight!

- 1 x 150kg squat ❌
- 1 x 90kg bench press ❌

## To the end of february

## To the end of january ✔️:

Since january is starting with me being sick, the goal is to get back to gym and
start exercising.
