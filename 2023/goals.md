# Gym goals for 2023

## May (2/3)

- 1 x 150kg on squat
- 1 x 160kg on deadlift
- 1 x 90kg on bench press

## April (2/3)

Squats are only problem... When I squat I don't have confidence. But I did
2 x 4 x 130kg, soooo I think I might be able to barely do the 8 x 130kg

- 8 x 130kg on squat ❌
- 8 x 130kg on deadlift ✔️
- 5 x 80kg on bench press ✔️

## To the end of march

I did only singles, and twos, and that was a mistake. In the end of the month
I couldn't go heavier. So I must do more reps, even with lower weight!

- 1 x 160kg on deadlift ❌
- 1 x 150kg squat ❌
- 1 x 90kg bench press ❌

## To the end of february

- get comfortable (hit atleast 2 reps) with 140kg on deadlift ✔️
- get comfortable (hit atleast 2 reps) with 140kg on squat ✔️

start exercising.
