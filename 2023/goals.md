# Gym goals for 2023

## July

Gonna back down from strength and focus on the swimming competition

## June (2/3)

Deadlift and squat were clean, happy with them. On the bench press I still need
to train with the 90kg with more reps, the 100kg wasn't even close

- 1 x 150kg on squat ✔️
- 1 x 160kg on deadlift ✔️
- 1 x 100kg on bench press ❌

## May (1/3)

The MSR that I had put the squat on pause, but I feel I'm close to it. The same
goes for the deadlift

- 1 x 150kg on squat ❌
- 1 x 160kg on deadlift ❌
- 1 x 90kg on bench press ✔️

## April (2/3)

Squats are only problem... When I squat I don't have confidence. But I did
2 x 4 x 130kg, soooo I think I might be able to barely do the 8 x 130kg

- 8 x 130kg on squat ❌
- 8 x 130kg on deadlift ✔️
- 5 x 80kg on bench press ✔️

## To the end of march

I did only singles, and twos, and that was a mistake. In the end of the month
I couldn't go heavier. So I must do more reps, even with lower weight!

- 1 x 160kg on deadlift ❌
- 1 x 150kg squat ❌
- 1 x 90kg bench press ❌

## To the end of february

- get comfortable (hit atleast 2 reps) with 140kg on deadlift ✔️
- get comfortable (hit atleast 2 reps) with 140kg on squat ✔️
- get comfortable (hit atleast 2 reps) with 80kg on bench ✔️

## To the end of january ✔️:

Since january is starting with me being sick, the goal is to get back to gym and
start exercising.
