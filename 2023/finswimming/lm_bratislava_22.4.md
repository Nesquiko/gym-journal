# LM Bratislava 22.4.2023

Didn't swim for a week, because the pool wasn't open due to a malfunction.
Also didn't slow down in the gym, so that also had some effect on me.

## 50 SF

PB: 16"83
Time: 17"13

Didn't feel like I was going fast, but somehow I beat my time from last week.
So, when I will be rested and relaxed, this will go under 17" for sure.

## 100 SF

PB: 38"34
Time: 39"35

First 50 was fast, but on the turn I slowed down and lost my speed. The way back
was painful, really painful, my quads were full of lactic acid. When I came out
of water, they were like balloons. Nonetheless, I think this is the right strategy,
blast on 1st 50 and then try to survive on the way back

## 400 Im

PB: ?????
Time: 3m 54"03

Went for a light swim, didn't race with anybody, just enjoyed the 400.
