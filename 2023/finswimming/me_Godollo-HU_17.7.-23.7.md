# Finswimming European Championships Godollo - Hungary 2023

## Day 1

Woke up with stomach problems, it wasn't just me, all teams had this problem.

### 100 SF

PB: 38"30
Time: 38"56

The first 50 was slow (17"8), didn't even fatigue on the second one.

### 4x50 SF relay, 3rd segment

Time: 16"18

Didn't feel like I was this fast, felt slugish. I think I caught a good wave.

## Day 2

### 100 IM

PB: 36"33
Time: 36"33 new PB!

I am very happy with this, since it shows that I have the 100 in me, but I
messed up the first 100 SF in the 1st day.

## Day 3

### 50 SF

PB: 16"83
Time: 16"95

Not great not terrible. I was hyped from the 1st day from the relay. Felt like
I didn't get in good position, must try the cord pulls to simulate higher speeds.

### Day 4

### 50 AP

PB: 15"42
Time: 15"57

Don't what went wrong, I felt much faster. Simply didn't have it in me.
