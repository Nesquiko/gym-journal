# MSR 2023

My only goal was to swim 1 A limit, and I did that!

## 100 SF

PB: 38"34
Time: 38"63

Well, when I was swimming I thought I was faster, but the strategy to swim the
first 50 without limits was a good one.

## 100 SF on relay

PB: 38"30
Time: 38"30 New PB!

Well, the pump helped me. First 50 was in 17"3, I must get that even faster,
I have reserves there. Also I didn't stiffen as much, I think the pump was
the reason. Also on the second apnea I must swim on side as long as possible.

## 100 Im

PB: unknown, around 36"9
Time: 37"04

Swam the A limit on this. Well, I don't have much to say, just that the first
50 must be faster, as on the surface

## 50 SF

PB: 16"83
Time: 17"41

I was satisfied with the 2 A limits, so I wasn't nervous, or anything.
Retrospectively, this 50 was sluggish, I must train to brace my whole upper
body and get into that springy kick feeling
