# WC Eger

Went on this competition without any expectations, because I raced, I think
9 months ago. Also bought new swimsuit. Yingfa, and it is very good. There
are no problems with putting it on, and with down. Yet they are solid on me,
no water leeks, I like them.

## 50 AP

PB: 15"44
Time: 15"42 - new PB

Didn't expect this, at all, but after 4.5 years I swam a new PB. I missed this
feeling, I smiled while I had butterflies in my stomach. Everything felt good,
didn't notice anything wrong, only suble errors. To get better time, I think,
I must work on streamline position, I must like a stone and hold it whole time.

## 100 SF

PB: 38"34
Time: 38"8

I am happy that I swam it under 39". First 50 was in 18"22, which I think
is slow, it should be in 17". And the second 50 was painful, my legs were
full of lactic acid. I must work on this phase, more lacate sets.

## 50 SF

PB: 16"83
Time: 17"15

Weeeeell, I wasn't disappointed, but I wanted at least to go under 17. But, the
first 15AP meters I did only 12, this was a mistake. Also I must learn how to
hold upper body in one solid position, the whole 50, and hold my hands under water
surface.
