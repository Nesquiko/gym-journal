# Workouts for 17.10. - 23.10.2022

## Monday 17.10.

There was a fire alarm exercise in the building. We evacuated the building,
waited for around 15 minutes and went back in. I also drove my dad to
airport, so I was there around 6:20 and then the alarm.
So skipped basically whole workout, did the squats and one exercise for calves.

   - Tried 130kg, was easy, upped to 140kg.
   - Next time go for 140kg, but with lower box.
   - I squatted in upper range of the lift, due to box height.
   - I'm comfotable in this range with 140kg.
   - working sets: 1 x 3 x 130kg, 2 x 3 x 140kg
