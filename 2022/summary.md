# Summary of 2022

Since I started writing down and planning my workouts, I saw relatively big
progress. I hit 160kg on deadlift, I can squat 140kg with confidence, lastly
my bench improved little bit.

## What I learned

### Following the plan

Sometimes body is not ready for the plan. It is OK to not follow the plan
completely, of course, I'm not talking about times when I am lazy, but for
example, when I'm not feeling 100% ok, or when my shoulder hurts, or when I have
something urgent right after the workout, so I don't have time.

### Style of workouts

I'm not a bodybuilder, nor I aspire to be one. My workouts had many exercises
with few sets. I changed them to have less exercises, but more sets, or more
variations, for example, bench press 3 x 5 x 70 and then 4 x 15 x 50. This style
will benefit allow me to train the movements I like (squat, deadlift, bench
press) more and challenge the muscles used in those movements from a different
angle.

### Planning

Planning can be boring. Planning on Sunday doesn't reflect how I'm feeling on
Friday. Listen to myself more and don't plan without thinking.

### Nutrition

Even bulking is hard, I thought that I will just eat everything. I was wrong,
I will only gain fat when doing it this way. I must come up with some system how
to eat more, eat more protein, eat more calories.

## What to improve in 2023

1. think more when planning
2. also think about nutrition
